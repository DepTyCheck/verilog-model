Expected integral \(non-'real'\) input to
Output port connection '[A-z]+' connects real to non-real
Wire inputs its own output, creating circular logic
Variable has same name as instance
Instance has the same name as port
Variable has same name as CELLINLINE
Operator ASSIGNW expected non-complex non-double Assign RHS in width check
Input port connection '[A-z]+' expected non-complex non-double pin connection in width check
Unsupported tristate port expression: VARREF '__Vcellinpt__
Unsupported tristate construct: INITITEM
Assigning to input\/const variable:
V3Gate\.cpp:872: Circular logic should have been rejected by okVisitor
Found definition of 'std' as a PACKAGE but expected a variable
CONST .* is not an unpacked array, but is in an unpacked array context
CONST .* unexpected in assignment to unpacked array
Input port connection .* to inout signal requires .* bits, but connection's VARREF .* generates .* bits\.
Output port connection .* to inout signal requires .* bits, but connection's VARREF .* generates .* bits\.
Slices of arrays in assignments have different unpacked dimensions, .* versus .*
Unsupported: trireg
VARREF .* is not an unpacked array, but is in an unpacked array context
Unsupported tristate construct \(in graph; not converted\): CONST .*
(AND|NOT) unexpected in assignment to unpacked array
Unsupported tristate construct (\(not in propagation graph\)|\(in graph; not converted\)): (OR|ASSIGNW|AND|VARREF .*)
Array initialization should have been removed earlier
